\subsection*{Objective}
During this workshop we will introduce fundamental concepts of multivariate dimention reduction, including the exploration and analysis of a single data set and the integrative analysis of multiple data sets. We will present statistical concepts such as covariance and correlation, multiple linear regression, classification and prediction, cross-validation, selection of diagnostic or prognostic markers, l$_1$ and l$_2$ penalties in a regression framework. \\
Each methodology that will be presented will be applied on biological `omics studies that include transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, metagenomics data sets using our \R{mixOmics} R package, alternating theory and application on the case studies.


\subsection*{Requirements}
We expect the trainees to have a good working knowledge in R (e.g. handling data frames and perform simple calculations). Attendees are requested to bring their \textbf{own laptop}. % and their \textbf{own data they wish to analyse} during the last third day of the training. \\


To run the \R{R} scripts in this workshop, you \textit{may} need to install or update the \textit{latest} version of \textbf{R} available from the CRAN (currently > 3.4, \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}), followed by the update or installation of the \R{R} package \R{mixOmics} version 6.4.1 with one of the two following options: %See more details at \url{http://mixomics.org/2018/06/software-requirements-for-2018-mixomics-workshop/}. 

Installation from bioconductor:
<< eval = FALSE >>=
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
 BiocManager::install("mixOmics")
@

Alternatively, you can install the development version of the package from Github.
<< eval = FALSE>>=
BiocManager::install("mixOmicsTeam/mixOmics/")
@
 
\textbf{For apple mac users}, if you are unable to install the \texttt{mixOmics} imported library \R{rgl} (\textit{rgl.so} error), you will \textbf{first} need to install the XQuartz software \url{https://www.xquartz.org/}. In addition we strongly advise using the \textbf{RStudio software} \url{http://www.rstudio.com/}.

Dr Kim-Anh L\^{e} Cao (University of Melbourne, Australia) was awarded her PhD in 2008 at Université de Toulouse, France. She then moved to Australia as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Queensland, Brisbane.  Since the beginning of her PhD Kim-Anh has initiated a wide range of valuable collaborative and research opportunities in both statistics and molecular biology. Her main research focus is on variable selection for biological data (`omics' data) coming from different functional levels by the means of multivariate dimension reduction approaches. Since 2009, her team has been working on developing a statistical software dedicated to the integrative analysis of `omics' data, to help researchers make sense of biological big data. Kim-Anh is a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne (Melbourne Integrative Genomics, School of Mathematics and Statistics), and regularly runs statistical training workshops and short series seminars as well as mixOmics multi-day workshops. More details on Kim-Anh current research and collaborative projects: \url{http://lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au/}.

During her spare time, Kim-Anh is a keen rock climber and bushwalker. Her favourite or common travel destinations are France and South Africa.
