# Introduction {#intro}

`mixOmics` is a freely available R package currently implementing nineteen methodologies for the exploration and the integration of biological data sets. Note that `mixOmics` is not limited to biological data only and can be applied to other type of data where integration is required. A strong focus is given to graphical representation to better understand the relationships between omics data and visualize the correlation structure at the sample and variable levels.

## Input data
A few notes about the data pre-processing that is required before analysing data with `mixOmics`:

- **Types of data and normalisation**. Different types of biological data can be explored and integrated with `mixOmics`. Prior to the analysis, we assume the data sets have been normalised using appropriate techniques specific for the type of 'omics technology platform. The methods can handle molecular features measured on a continuous scale (e.g. microarray, mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics) or sequenced-based count data (RNA-seq, 16S, shotgun metagenomics) that become ``continuous'' data after pre-processing and normalisation. 

- **Prefiltering**. While `mixOmics` methods can handle large data sets (several tens of thousands of predictors), we recommend pre-filtering the data to less than 10K predictors per data set, for example by using Median Absolute Deviation [@Ten16] for RNA-seq data, by removing consistently low counts in microbiome data sets [@Lec16] or by removing near zero variance predictors. Such step aims to lessen the computational time during the parameter tuning process.

- **Data format**. 
The numeric data matrix or data frame `X` has $n$ observations or samples in rows and $p$ predictors (e.g. expression levels of $p$ genes), in columns.

- **Covariates**. In the current version of `mixOmics`, covariates that may confound the analysis are not included in the methods. We recommend correcting for those covariates beforehand using appropriate univariate or multivariate methods for batch effect removal.

## Methods

### What do you need to know?

Here are the main methodological pre-requisites to be comfortable in using `mixOmics` efficiently:

- **Individuals, observations or samples**: the experimental units on which informations are collected, e.g. patients, mouse...

- **Variables**: information acquired for samples, e.g. weight, height, gene expressions... 

- **Variance**: an indicator of spread for one variable. The higher the variance, the most scattered the observations.

- **Covariance**: an indicator of relationships for 2 sets of observations. The higher the covariance, the most related the 2 variables, e.g weight and height or peoples frequently vary in the same way; roughly, the heaviest are the tallest.

- **Correlation**: a standardized version of the covariance that take values between -1 and 1.

- **Linear combination**: a way to combine several variables by multiplying each by a coefficient and adding everything, e.g. 2xweight - 1.5xheight is a linear combination of the 2 variables weight and height with teh coefficients 1 and -1.5.

- **Component**: a linear combination of the variables of a data set with coefficients optimally determined, e.g, in Principal Component Analysis, a (Principal) component is defined with coefficients that maximize the variance of the coordinates of the samples on the component.

- **Loadings**: the coefficients associated to the variable to define a component.

- **Sample plot**: representation of the samples in a space defined by components.

- **Correlation circle plot**: representation of the variables in a space defined by components; the coordinate of one variable on one component is calculated as the correlation between the variable and the component.
